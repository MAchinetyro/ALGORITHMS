# ALGORITHMS
This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning techniques using Python. It includes the following features:

<h3><u><b>*Data preprocessing and visualization</b></u></h3>
<h3><u><b>*Implementation of machine learning models</b></u></h3>
<h3><u><b>*Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as ROC curves</b></u></h3>
<h3><u><b>*Plotting and visualization of results</b></u></h3>
<h1><u><b>Key Components</b></u></h1>
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps to clean and prepare data for modeling.
Model Training: Implements multiple machine learning models to predict outcomes.
Model Evaluation: Utilizes performance metrics and visualizations, such as ROC curves, to evaluate model accuracy.
